# BorderCheck

BorderCheck is a fictional diagnostic tool designed to illustrate surveillance patterns in browser extensions. It maps emotional resonance, telemetry transparency, and consent structure through a trace scoring model.

## ✨ Features

- Dropdown-based selection of example extensions
- Trace score calculation across five dimensions
- Visual zone-based feedback with heat icons
- Minimalist UI for quiet reflection

## ⚖️ Trace Dimensions

- **Jurisdiction**: Regulatory context and scope
- **Consent**: Opt-in mechanisms and clarity
- **Update**: Transparency of versioning and sync
- **Trace**: Visibility of analytics and telemetry
- **Emotional**: Presence of behavioral modeling

## 🚦 Trace Zones

| Score Range | Zone                | Icon |
|-------------|---------------------|------|
| 0           | Opaque Trace        | 🟥   |
| 1–2         | Active Surveillance | 🟠   |
| 3–4         | Consent Optional    | 🟡   |
| 5           | Transparent Use     | 🟢   |

> BorderCheck is not a real diagnostic tool and does not evaluate actual browser extensions. It exists to provoke conversation about surveillance design, telemetry visibility, and emotional risk.

## 🎨 Inspired By

BorderCheck is conceptually aligned with [Percept](https://github.com/your-username/percept) and other emotionally reflective tools in civic design.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Serve locally using Live Preview or Live Server  
3. Select a fictional extension from the dropdown  
4. Reflect on its trace score and zone

## 📦 Future Ideas

- Support trace layering for multiple tools  
- Explore acoustic trace feedback  
- Integrate accessibility indicators beyond score visibility
